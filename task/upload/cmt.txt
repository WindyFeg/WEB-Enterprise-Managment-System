Moon looking bright tonight
High in the sky
Like trying to keep you alive
Alright
Just stay away from me
Let me down easily

You’re too late
You’re too late

Don’t you pray
Don’t you pray

Seeking for my embrace
Wanting my touch, begging me to stay

Every night and day
Calling my name, shout it still you break

You took my heart,, Held it and ripped apart
Make me a prisoner,
Got me going right under

Feelling that you feign?
Fooling me again….
No need to explain
Taking my own lane

God’s helping me out
Get over my doubt
Thought I can’t live without
Forget you right now

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

Making My Way
Making My Way

I wanna know the cure
For all that time you make me endure
All the words you say
Ought to keep your prey well and behaved

I reckon’ it’s time
Betting my luck on dimes
Taking new leap in
Getting far away from your cheating
Seeking for my embrace
Wanting my touch, begging me to stay
Every night and day
Calling my name, shout it still you break

You took my heart,, Held it and ripped it apart
Make me a prisoner,
Got me going right under

Feelling that you feign?
Fooling me again….
No need to explain
Taking my own lane

God’s helping me out
Get over my doubt
Thought I can’t live without
Forget you right now

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

Making My Way
Making My Way

BEST PART: ------------------

Telling me I’ll kill for you

Like a truth

With no proof

Never knew

Was a doll, now the thing you pulled,

Never make me yield

Pin you down like a golden view

Right uphill

Make you dwell

What I feel

Wish you well

Living right in the kingdom I built a new

Draining tears and wallow in guilt
